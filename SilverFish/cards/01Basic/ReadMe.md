Basic is one of two core [card sets](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_set) in [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Hearthstone), the other being the [Classic](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Classic) set. The set was first made available to the public in January 2014 when beta-testing was first announced for the game, which was then called [Classic Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Classic_Hearthstone). The Basic set features 133 [cards](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card), the same number of cards as when it was first released.

The purpose of the Basic and Classic sets is to ground players in cards which players will always be familiar with, in the face of an ever-changing pool of cards available to be played in [Standard format](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Standard_format). Throughout [Hearthstone's history](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Hearthstone_timeline), major and minor [card changes](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_changes) have been implemented to the Basic set.
