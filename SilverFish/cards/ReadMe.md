Classic (formerly known as Expert) is the largest card set in Hearthstone, with 245 collectible cards. The Classic set serves as one of the two core card sets in Hearthstone, the other being the Basic set. The set was first made available to the public in January 2014 when beta-testing was first announced for the game, in the era of Classic Hearthstone.

The Classic set's purpose is to ground players in a core set in which players will always be familiar with, in the face of an ever-changing pool of cards available to be played in Standard format. The Classic and Basic sets are the only two permanent sets that will always be available to be played in Standard format, while all other sets will eventually move over time to Wild format.

Classic cards frequently feature as core cards in successful decks, and the developers constantly monitor the set's power to ensure the cards do not form too large a proportion of decklists, thus causing the meta to become excessively stale. Consequently, throughout Hearthstone's history, many major and minor card changes have been implemented to cards in the Classic set, and occasionally certain Classic cards have been moved to Wild format in the Hall of Fame set, with new card additions taking their place in Classic.
