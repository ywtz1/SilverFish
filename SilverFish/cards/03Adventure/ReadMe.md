Adventures are a single-player game mode in which the player participates in adventure-themed matches played against computer-controlled opponents. Adventures can be selected in the Solo Adventures screen, accessed through the Solo Adventures button from the main menu.

Adventures offer a unique way to play Hearthstone. Unlike other types of play, each adventure has a specific theme and identity, featuring heroes, cards, art and music in keeping with that setting, including some cards and mechanics not playable in more traditional modes. Past adventures featured wings that the player would unlock to discover new bosses to play against, using specially-prepared user-made decks, and new Class Challenges to play using pre-made decks. Adventures can be played in two difficulty settings: either Normal or Heroic mode. All adventures are played in Wild format, allowing the use of any cards in the player's collection.

Cards introduced by an adventure form a card set. These cards are obtained through defeating bosses and Class Challenges in the adventure.

Adventures are not available to new players until they have unlocked every class. Practice mode is a type of adventure, but functions differently from the other adventures in that it is an introductory mode to new players. Practice mode is available to all players.
